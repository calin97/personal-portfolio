Additionally, users can bookmark their favorite recipes and even create and save their own personalized recipes. For this project, I utilized an API for retrieving recipes and implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to organize and manage the code. To store bookmarked data, I incorporated local storage. Furthermore, I optimized the final output for performance and efficiency by utilizing Parcel and NPM.
                    I faced difficulties while attempting to refactor the code to adhere to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, as well as when devising an algorithm to update the Document Object Model (DOM). </p>

The application offers various features such as the ability to transfer money, request a loan, and close an account. Additionally, it provides a transaction history log, and a log timer has been implemented for security purposes.
                    During the process of completing this project, I gained knowledge about various programming methods and concepts. Specifically, I learned about using filter and reduce methods to manipulate data, as well as how to utilize flat and flatMap methods appropriately. Additionally, I gained insights into sorting arrays and using timers to enhance the application's performance. Finally, I also became familiar with internationalizing dates, which will allow for greater flexibility in handling date formats across different regions.

                  <p class="project-paragraph">The project is a two-player fighting game. Player 1 uses 'a' (left), 'd' (right), 'w' (jump), and space bar (attack). Player 2 uses arrow keys for left, right, jump, and attack (arrowLeft, arrowRight, arrowup, and arrowdown respectively). Player one inflicts higher damage (20 damage per hit), but has a slower attack speed. In contrast, player two has a faster attack speed but inflicts lower damage (10 damage per hit). For this fighting game project, I used OOP and switch case for player movement and collisions. To incorporate graphics and animations, I utilized the canvas element to create a rectangular area on the web page. This project provided an excellent opportunity to exercise algorithmic thinking and strengthen fundamental knowledge of vanilla JavaScript.</p>

Furthermore, I became familiar with DOM traversing and how to implement a sticky navigation, as well as revealing elements on scroll.

The game mechanics allow players to accumulate points by holding their score, and the first player to reach 21 points is declared the winner. An interesting aspect of the game is that if a player rolls a 1 on the dice, they lose their turn entirely.
                    This project served as an opportunity for me to become more familiar with programming concepts and developing skills in DOM manipulations. Additionally, I also gained insights into CSS manipulation techniques, which helped me to better understand how to create visually appealing and responsive web pages.
